          Why do you confuse yourselves by worrying? Leave the care of your
          affairs to me and everything will be peaceful. I say to you in truth
          that every act of true, blind, complete surrender to me produces the
          effect that you desire and resolves all difficult situations.

          Surrender to me does not mean to fret, to be upset, or to lose hope,
          nor does it mean offering to me a worried prayer asking me to follow
          you and change your worry into prayer. It is against this surrender,
          deeply against it, to worry, to be nervous and to desire to think
          about the consequences of anything. It is like the confusion that
          children feel when they ask their mother to see to their needs, and
          then try to take care of those needs for themselves so that their
          childlike efforts get in their mother’s way. Surrender means to
          placidly close the eyes of the soul, to turn away from thoughts of
          tribulation and to put yourself in my care, so that only I act,
          saying, “You take care of it.”

          How many things I do when the soul, in so much spiritual and material
          need, turns to me, looks at me and says to me, “You take care of it,”
          then closes its eyes and rests. In pain you pray for me to act, but
          that I act in the way you want. You do not turn to me, instead, you
          want me to adapt to your ideas. You are not sick people who ask the
          doctor to cure you, but rather sick people who tell the doctor how to.
          So do not act this way, but pray as I taught you in the Our Father:
          “Hallowed be thy Name,” that is, be glorified in my need. “Thy kingdom
          come,” that is, let all that is in us and in the world be in accord
          with your kingdom. “Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,”
          that is, in our need, decide as you see fit for our temporal and
          eternal life. If you say to me truly: “Thy will be done,” which is the
          same as saying: “You take care of it,” I will intervene with all my
          omnipotence, and I will resolve the most difficult situations.

          You see evil growing instead of weakening? Do not worry. Close your
          eyes and say to me with faith: “Thy will be done, You take care of
          it.” I say to you that I will take care of it, and that I will
          intervene as does a doctor and I will accomplish miracles when they
          are needed. Do you see that the sick person is getting worse? Do not
          be upset, but close your eyes and say, “You take care of it.” I say to
          you that I will take care of it, and that there is no medicine more
          powerful than my loving intervention. By my love, I promise this to
          you.

          on the other bank of the river. What troubles you and hurts you
          immensely are your reason, your thoughts and worry, and your desire at
          all costs to deal with what afflicts you.

          You are sleepless; you want to judge everything, direct everything and
          see to everything and you surrender to human strength, or worse—to men
          themselves, trusting in their intervention—this is what hinders my
          words and my views. Oh, how much I wish from you this surrender, to
          help you; and how I suffer when I see you so agitated! Satan tries to
          do exactly this: to agitate you and to remove you from my protection
          and to throw you into the jaws of human initiative. So, trust only in
          me, rest in me, surrender to me in everything.

          I perform miracles in proportion to your full surrender to me and to
          your not thinking of yourselves. I sow treasure troves of graces when
          you are in the deepest poverty. No person of reason, no thinker, has
          ever performed miracles, not even among the saints. He does divine
          works whosoever surrenders to God. So don’t think about it any more,
          because your mind is acute and for you it is very hard to see evil and
          to trust in me and to not think of yourself. Do this for all your
          needs, do this, all of you, and you will see great continual silent
          miracles. I will take care of things, I promise this to you.

          Pray always in readiness to surrender, and you will receive from it
          great peace and great rewards, even when I confer on you the grace of
          immolation, of repentance, and of love. Then what does suffering
          matter? It seems impossible to you? Close your eyes and say with all
          your soul, “Jesus, you take care of it.” Do not be afraid, I will take
          care of things and you will bless my name by humbling yourself. A
          thousand prayers cannot equal one single act of surrender, remember
          this well. There is no novena more effective than this.
